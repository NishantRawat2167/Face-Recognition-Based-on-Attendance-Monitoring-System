# Face-Recognition-Based-on-Attendance-Monitoring-System

This project implements a face recognition-based attendance monitoring system designed to streamline and automate the process of tracking attendance. Using advanced facial recognition technology, this system can detect and recognize registered individuals and log their attendance in a secure and efficient manner.

Features

Face Detection and Recognition: Uses a pre-trained machine learning model to detect and recognize faces.
Automated Attendance Logging: Automatically logs attendance data in real-time.
User Management: Admin interface to add, edit, and delete users.
Secure Data Handling: Ensures the security and privacy of user data.
Real-time Notifications: Sends notifications upon successful recognition and logging of attendance.

Technologies Used

Python: The primary programming language used for the backend.
OpenCV: For real-time computer vision tasks.
dlib: For machine learning and data analysis.
Flask: A micro web framework used to build the web interface.
SQLite: For storing attendance records.
HTML/CSS/JavaScript: For the front-end interface.
